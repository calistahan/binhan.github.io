**Yuki** is a current undergraduate student studying Cybersecurity. 

She grew up with a love for technology and computers and soon found a passion for information security - which led to the birth of this blog.

Yuki's hope for this blog is simply to document her growth and learning, and serve as a reference/review source and archive to jog her memory when needed. If it ends up helping someone else along the way, that's a plus!
